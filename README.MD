### Formatting breadcrumbs and previous/next links
When adding permalinks in pages to other pages, either for breadcrumbs or for next/previous page follow these rules:
 - DO include the leading forward slash
 - DO NOT include the trailing forward slash

Example:

|Correctly formatting|Incorrect formatting |
|---|---|
|`/guide/kickoff`|`/guide/kickoff/`|
| |`guide/kickoff`|
