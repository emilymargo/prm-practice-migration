## The decision to migrate and funding {#decision-to-migrate-and-funding}

This guide offers guidance fromthe point at which the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) has approved the practice’s request to change their principal clinical system and are ready to start the migration process. 

Note: This is subject to the conditions described in the [CCG-Practice Agreement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/terms-governing-the-provision-and-receipt-of-gpsoc-services-and-gp-it-services/)) 

Prior to this, there are a number of steps that will have been completed such as:

* Practice completes a GPSoC business case justification template for the migration and provides evidence of the drivers, practice considerations and strategic fit.


* Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and any local boards approve the business case and secure funding. 

  -- _Note: there may be [further costs identified by the Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) for replacing hardware_


* Practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) engage with their GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit)


Once the decision to migrate has been confirmed, the next steps are to:


### Agree a provisional Go Live date

A preferred Go Live date needs to be agreed between the Practice and the supporting functions  - usually the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and a GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit). 

A proposed go-live date should be agreed between the practice, Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and GP IT delivery partner. 

This proposed date should be agreed with the new clinical system supplier

__Recommendation__ - Avoid busy periods for your practice and surrounding area and watch out for any periods with a high volume of staff on training or annual leave.

### Register the migration on the Tracking Database

The initial registration of the migration on the [Tracking Database](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/tracking-database) is usually completed by the Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) however this may differ by region.


#### Procure the new system

* A _Schedule A_ document is completed for the new supplier (target) and is “called off”/logged in the Tracking Database

* The Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) accepts the _Schedule A_ in the Tracking Database

* The new supplier (target) receives the _Schedule A_ notification and accepts it

* The new supplier (target) will confirm the availability of the preferred Go live dates


{%- capture lesson_learnt_2 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - Submodules of the new clinical system may need to be raised in a _Schedule A_, this activity can be missed. For example, appointments modules, document management, data entry forms

#### Decommission the existing/old system system

The same process happens for the decommissioning of the Source Supplier, a _Schedule A_ is “called off”/logged in the Tracking Database.


{%- capture lesson_learnt_3 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - If the _Schedule A_ to decommission the source supplier’s system is not sent at this point the NHS will continue to pay for the service for longer than needed.
{%- endcapture -%}

{%- include inset.html content=lesson_learnt_3 accessibility_text="Lesson learnt" markdown=true -%}

__Important__ - At this point, you should think about submitting a [formal data extract request to the Source Supplier](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#request-a-data-extract-from-your-existing-supplier) to avoid any delays to your migration.

The Source Suppliers have varying lead times/notice periods to provide this data upon request (for example, a supplier may require up to 5 weeks notice). 


{%- capture lesson_learnt_4 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - __Any delays to [requesting the data extract](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks#request-a-data-extract-from-your-existing-supplier) may impact the migration timeline__ if it’s not sent well in advance of the [initial data production day](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production).

### Arrange your Kick-off and Technical Survey

Plan and book your [Kick-off meeting](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off) and [Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) to happen within a few days of each other.
