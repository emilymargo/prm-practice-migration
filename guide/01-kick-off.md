## What is a ‘Kick-off’?

A ‘Kick-off’ is where you gather all the key people who will be involved in your migration to discuss the end to end process of migrating your system. The objective is to assign roles and get everyone on the same page about what needs to happen and when.


### As a priority you should discuss...

* The key milestones and week by week activities


* Agree dates and targets for the above milestones and activities


* Who will be involved in the migration and what are their roles and responsibilities?


* How you will communicate and share information?

### For the Kick-off meeting, you should involve at a minimum...

* The migration Project manager - This may be a representative from your CSU/CCG or in some cases the Practice manager or lead GP


* Practice managers - Including any staff that will play a role in managing/supporting the migration


* Target system supplier - The supplier of the clinical system you are moving to

Note: When Commissioning Support Units (CSUs) are leading the migration, they may invite other personnel to the Kick-off such as Business change, Training leads, Data quality etc.

## Key milestones, activities, dates and targets

By now you should have agreed on your Go Live date. Take a look at the [surrounding phases](/prm-practice-migration/guide#overview-of-key-phases) and put dates in your plan of when any activities need to be completed (Use the content on this site to guide you). It is worthwhile stepping through each of the phases and making sure that everyone is aligned on what the phase objective is and what the key are activities within them.

As you go, you may want to create a shared list of actions for each phase, with a column for a target date,  who will complete the action and a status/update column. Use this list to track progress throughout the migration.



## Who, roles and responsibilities

As part of the Kick-off, you should discuss who should be involved in the migration and what their roles and responsibilities will be. If people are not present in the Kick-off, think about how you will onboard them and understand their role. As you work through your list of roles, capture and consolidate any contact information for individuals. 

Here is a list of common organisations and functions you may wish to engage with and involve in your migration.

* Project manager
* Practice manager
* Practice staff
* A General Practitioner to act as a lead 
* Clinical staff (including people who may work remotely)
* Commissioning Support Unit (CSU)
* Explore with your CSU the availability of any supporting roles such as Business change, Training leads, Data quality teams etc
* Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)
* Target supplier - The new supplier of the GP Core System
* Source supplier - Existing/old supplier of the GP Core System
* Surrounding and community services - Pharmacies, Prescriptions, Test labs etc 
* Third party system suppliers, for example DocMan



## Schedule regular migration meetings

Now is a good time to schedule regular migration meetings.

* We suggest holding them on a weekly basis at the same time


* Book rooms and make sure everyone who needs to can attend


* Keep call conference IDs tools consistent i.e. try to reuse the same conference call setup so that all participants can access it easily and repeatedly


* Agree how you’ll all communicate and share information between meetings



## Check dates against availability

Look at your key dates and the people you need

* Plan for critical days - identify and make sure that people are made aware and will be available


* Do staff have pre-booked holidays or training planned?


* Are there any planned events or surgeries during this time that you should rearrange?

The aim is to ensure a successful migration and limit the impact on the practice by reducing the amount of practice activity happening and increase the availability of people to support the migration.

###  Secure your dates and people’s time 

* Block time for your key dates


* Prevent new holidays being booked on these dates


* Prevent any events or clinical reviews from being planned at this time e.g. Asthma reviews


* Pre-book rooms for training / testing and any other migration activity



## Additional topics for your Kick-off

The Kick-off is a good opportunity to also run through the following...


### Common data issues, housekeeping and clean up tasks

Ask the Target supplier or Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) to walk through any common/known data issues when migrating to the new system - these may vary from system to system. 

The objective is to identify any tasks that the Practice can start rectifying early and before the [Initial data production phase](initial-data-production). As time goes on, the amount of work the Practice needs to complete will grow, so getting ahead can ease the pressure.

If you have access to a Data Quality team (possibly part of your Commissioning Support Unit), involve them now.

Discuss and plan any housekeeping tasks such as…

* The safe closure of old, duplicate, orphaned records or deceased patients which will not migrate to the new system

* Complete an information cleansing exercise to ensure only current letter templates and data entry templates are kept. Note; letter and data entry templates will need to be manually copied over. Completing this exercise will make it easier to identify which templates you need in the new system

* Clearing down the practice inboxes, outstanding workflows and all open communication tasks, for example pathology and registration;  as you approach the [Initial data production day](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production), you will want to have the least amount of tasks outstanding 

Now is also a good time to introduce the [Data checking tasks](/prm-practice-migration/guide/early-prep-and-planning#data-checking-preparation) and what the practice will need to do during the [Planning and preparation](early-prep-and-planning) phase, such as finding patients that match the test criteria supplied by the Target supplier.


### Technical survey and hardware

If the Practice is not already aware, the [Technical survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) (try to schedule the day after the Kick-off) may result in the identification of new or additional hardware being required for purchase and unexpected costs. This may not apply in all cases. You may want to highlight this early so that the Practice and Clinical Commissioning Group are aware of this possibility before the Technical survey is completed.


### Notification of 3rd parties and links

Make a list of all the supporting/connecting systems and community services that the Clinical system or the Practice works with, for example...

* Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)


* Pathology and test labs


* Pharmacies


* Third party software/system suppliers, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management

Next, plan and schedule how you will give notice to them of your system change. The earlier you give notice of your Cut-over and Go Live dates the better. The notice period required will vary, for example, the Electronic Prescription Service may require 5 weeks, whereas DocMan may require 5 days. 

If you use any third party software as part of your clinical system, please be aware that reconfiguration work may be required by them after you have migrated to the new clinical system [Post Go Live](post-go-live).

Add a task to your plan to contact and remind each party the week before and on the day when you require changes to be made.

### Notification of Patients

During the migration, you may need to remove access to online services such as the ability to book appointments online and you may also require patients to re-register on your new online service system (if applicable). Therefore, discuss how you will notify patients in advance. Most practices display posters many weeks in advance to create awareness. You may also want to discuss what online messaging is put in place when the service is removed e.g. what happens if a patient tries to access the online service when it ceases to be available. You may want to add this as a topic on the practice patient forum.


### Make staff aware of the coming changes

Are the practice staff (and any people who work remotely) aware of the change? Think about what questions they may have and how you plan to answer them.


### Training

We recommend you discuss how you will approach training at a high level. [Read more about training](training).
