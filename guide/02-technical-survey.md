Following your Kickoff meeting an engineer will need to complete a Technical Survey on site at the practice. 


## What is the Technical Survey?

The survey is to check the existing practice setup, focused mainly on the following three areas...

* __Hardware__ – All Hardware should be checked (client PCs, servers, arrivals kiosk, call display etc.) to ensure that they meet the required minimum specification for running the Target System.
** For dispensing practices, scanner and label printer compatibility also needs to be checked.
* __Network__ – Any existing network issues that may require addressing & may require extra chargeable engineering services, post go live, 
* __3rd party application/software compatibility__ - Applications that the Practice may use that are not part of the existing/old core Clinical system, but may be connecting to it, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management


Some Commissioning Support Units (CSUs) will download and install the Target System icons, to all the compatible devices following the survey.


## Who completes this activity?

The Technical Survey can be completed by the Target Supplier or in some cases by an engineer from your Commissioning Support Unit (CSU), check to see who will complete this activity.


## Outcome of the Technical Survey

The Technical survey may result in the identification of new or additional hardware being required for purchase and unexpected costs. This may not apply in all cases. Any additional costs should be discussed with the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).
