## What is it and purpose

The Initial Data Production is the point at which a copy of the existing clinical system data is provided to the new supplier, who import it into the new system. The Practice then test the new system to make sure that the Patient data is accurate and the new system is working as expected. 


## Who is involved?

* The Source Supplier  - who provide the data extract from the existing system
* The Target Supplier - who visit the Practice and import the data into the new system
* The Practice Staff - who test the data and new system
* The Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) - who support the Practice and work with the suppliers (Level of support available can vary by region)


## Preparation

The following activities should have been completed in advance…

* The Data extract has been requested from the existing supplier in advance (see previous phase)
* The Practice has identified the Patient records matching criteria provided by the Target Supplier for testing (see previous phase)
* Rooms have been booked for Initial Data Production meetings, training and Data Checking


## Setup access to the new system

As part of the Initial Data Production phase, the practice should be given access to the new system. The Target supplier will setup admin users (Usually up to three).

The Target supplier or Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) should provide basic training on the new system including how to login, change passwords and how to change the access rights for users.

__Lesson learnt__ - try to make sure that more than one member of staff attend the basic training and are setup with access as the Practice may be called upon by the Target Supplier to log into the new system and perform basic checks at later phases or reset passwords. Failing to do this has been known to cause delays to migration timelines.

## Data Checking

Data checking generally happens in 2-3 phases…

1. Initial data checking and reporting of any issues
2. Rechecking the data after the Target Supplier has amended any issue found
3. In some circumstances a third phase is required if further issues were found in the recheck, however, most migrations do not require this further recheck of the data.


### Timeline for Data Checking

All parties should agree on a timeline and target date for when the Data Checking tasks will be completed.

We advise you to plan for between 3-5 days for each data checking phase. However, the Rechecking phases may not take as long as the Initial Data Checking.

The Target Supplier should assist the Practice on the first day of the Phase 1 Initial data checking. 

{%- capture lesson_learnt_2 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - Try to block out time and dedicated staff to complete the Data Checking activity. If you have the ability, arrange cover for the staff to complete the daily running of the practice. We have found from research that Practices that do not have dedicated time and people for Data Checking can struggle to complete the activity and causes additional strain on staff, putting the migration timeline and success at risk.

{%- capture lesson_learnt_3 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - If possible, try to arrange access to additional support from the Target Supplier or the Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) for all the Initial Data Checking days. This is the period whereby staff are learning the new system for the first time and may have lots of questions that need answering. If not answered quickly, these questions or uncertainty could block or delay the Data Checking phase.

## What to test

The Target supplier or Commissioning Support Unit (CSU) should provide a complete list of Data checking activities.

The majority of testing will be focused on the identified patient records matching the criteria supplied by the Target Supplier along with the random patients.

Alongside checking the identified patient records, the Practice will be asked to check and compare reports such as QOF reports and indicator points, cytology and immunisation target reports, capitation figures and remapping local codes.

The data checking is a manual process, in most circumstances the practice staff will complete the activity with the use of two monitors side-by-side, one displaying the existing system and the other displaying the new system. Staff will cross reference the two to check their consistency.


### Reporting issues with Data

We recommend that issues are logged and reported to the Target Supplier as soon as they are found.

Each Target Supplier will have a set method of how they would like the issues to be reported. The Supplier should provide you with this information before or at the start of the Initial Data checking day.

At the end of each Data Checking phase, there will be a period whereby the Target Supplier will review and address the issues found, this may vary depending on the complexity of the issues reported.

The Target Supplier will notify the Practice when the issues have been fixed and the Practice will then need to check the issue

For quality assurance we recommend that the Practice recheck all identified records, not just the ones with issues.


## Signing off the Data Checking

Once all issues have been addressed and all data checking tasks have been rechecked, the Practice will be asked to ‘Sign off’ that the data is accurate and the Practice is satisfied with the quality of the data.
