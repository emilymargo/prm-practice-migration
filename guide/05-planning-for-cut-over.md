## What is the cut-over?

The cut-over is the transition from the old to the new system. The cut-over begins when…

* The new system is ready to be used (although it may not contain the data) and...
* Data entered into the old system will no longer be carried across into the new system (note: Practices may still enter data but it will not be migrated).

The cut-over ends when…

* The data has been imported into the new system and tested
* The Practice starts to use the new system as the primary system

During the cutover, the key activities are…

* Source Supplier will export the data and provide it to the Target Supplier. 
* The Target supplier will import the data into the new system
* The Practice will test and sign off the data
* The Practice will record any new data for manual re-entry after Go Live and when the cutover ends

**During Cutover, any data that is entered into the old system will not automatically transfer to your target supplier’s system**. Hence, it is important to plan for it ahead of time, usually a few weeks prior to your cut-over date.

## Planning for the cut-over


During the ‘Planning for the cut-over’ stage, you should gather all the key people who will be involved in your cut-over period to discuss how you are going to run the practice activities during this time. The objective is to decide what processes to follow during cut-over to ensure the practice runs smoothly and how you will approach data re-entry (and how to minimise the amount of re-entry needed). 


## General preparation

* Notify all the 3rd parties and services to switch off links/communications the day prior to final data production day. As highlighted in the [Kickoff](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kickoff#notification-of-3rd-parties-and-links) and [Early preparation & planning](/prm-practice-migration/guide/early-prep-and-planning#notification-of-3rd-parties-and-links) stages

* Notify Subsidiary Suppliers at least 5 days in advance of the start of the cutover, to provide their own data extract if needed i.e. Docman 

* Export any letter templates and clinical templates to Microsoft Word from the Source system (old) to be able to import them to the target supplier’s system (new) after the go-live date

* Clear down any inboxes and outstanding workflows and all open communication tasks e.g. pathology, registration etc

* Ensure that all users are logged off the source supplier system so that the supplier can do the data extraction



## Best practices and tactics for reducing the cut-over impact

### Appointments:  

* Switch to emergency only appointments or reduce the number of pre-booked appointments during the cut-over period and the Post Go Live week(s) - this is to ease the pressure on the staff but also to reduce the number of appointments that you will need to re-enter in Post Go Live.
* Schedule less slots in the rotas for the first couple of days post go-live if your clinicians are not familiar with the target supplier’s system. 
* Build rotas on the Deployment system before the cut-over 
* Avoid holding any special clinics such as Asthma Reviews in the week before, during and initial weeks after cut-over to again reduce pressure and re-entry.
* When you do have to book appointments you can book them in the old system, print it out and then keep a copy of it for re-entry after the cut-over. 


### Consultations: 
 
* Carry on as normal entering notes in the old system and manually transfer these to target source supplier as part of the data re-entry process once you have gone live.  


### Home visits:  

* Keep a record of requested visits so that you know which patients have data that need transferring once you are live.  


### Telephone calls to patients

* GPs/nurses need to ensure that all telephone calls to a patient are entered on to the new clinical system


* Ask them to keep a record of the name of the patient and the date they were called so that the records can be easily found during data re-entry


* In order to negate the risk of missed information, create a rota in the source supplier system, if possible, so that all the calls made can be logged there.  


### Prescriptions: 
 
* Keep a record of all prescription requests made/issued during the cut-over period. Ideally batch all the repeat prescription requests together by date order. If any requests are taken by phone/over the counter/any other method, you will need to make a note of those and add them to the batched information.  

* To reduce the amount of effort re-entering Prescription data, some practices choose to:  
  -- Issue two prescriptions (either posted dated or amendment to quantity) from the month before the Cut-over begins until a week after Go-Live.  
  -- For EPS repeat prescriptions, practices can revert back to issuing FP10s from the month before the Cut-over begins until a week after Go-Live. Changing the option from EPS to FP10 needs to happen on an individual patient basis. This can be done at the point of ordering all medications.  
* With either of these options it is important that patients and pharmacies are informed of this change at the earliest opportunity to avoid any confusion.


### Links:

* Cut off dates for reg and path links will be sent to you via e-mail. The backlog of pathology results will be sent electronically once you are live. 


### Referrals: 
 
* Print an extra copy of any referrals done during cut-over period. These can then be scanned into the target supplier system when you are live.  


### Scanning:
  
* Everything that comes in during the cut-over period will need to be scanned into the target system’s supplier once you are live. You need to make sure that you keep all the incoming letters together.  


### Bowel screening:  

* Ask the service to stop sending messages from a couple of days before cut-over starts until after go-live.  


### 111 messages/Incoming clinical correspondence: 

* Leave all the messages received during the cut-over period in the generic mailbox as they can be picked up from there and dropped into the target system once you are live. 
* You may want to print copies for your GPs to view.  


### Out Of Hours:  

* The Out of hours reports will continue to come into the source system during cut-over. 
* You will need to keep a copy of each for scanning into the target system once live.  


### Summarisation/routine data entry:  
* All of this will need to stop as the information will not be transferred to target supplier.  


For any of the above, you may need to arrange for emergency/urgent activities to be done manually, for example, urgent test results can be posted and the lab notify the Practice by phone. 


## Additional notes:  
* The source supplier system (old) maintenance support will continue for 3 months post go-live and you will have access to the system/data it for this period.  
* Any patients (other than deceased) deducted before your final data production won't migrate.  
* We strongly recommend that Practices draft in additional support/cover so that there is dedicated people/time for testing and re-entry.
