During the cutover period, any activity that takes place at your practice will not automatically transfer to your target supplier’s system. Hence, it is important to plan for it ahead of time, usually a few weeks prior to your cutover date.

During this stage, the practice gathers all the key people who will be involved in your cutover period to discuss how you are going to run the practice activities during this time. The objective is to decide what processes to follow during cutover and the approach to data re-entry. 

## Best practices and tactics for reducing the cutover impact

* Practice collates a list of all the 3rd parties and services to switch off links/communications the day prior to final data production day.

* Practice notifies Subsidiary Suppliers 5 days in advance of data extract target date, to provide their own data extract if needed i.e. Docman (Note: referenced as 3rd party supplier in data migration standard and ancillary doc).

* Practice exports the letter templates and clinical templates to Microsoft Word from the Source system to be able to import them to the target supplier’s system after the go-live date

* Practice Manager ensures that all users are logged off the source supplier system so that the supplier can do the data extraction

* Practice clear down their inbox and outstanding workflows and all open communication tasks e.g. pathology, registration etc


## Specifically prepare for cutover handling of the following activities:

* Appointments:
  - Practice builds rotas on the Deployment system.
  - Try to cut the rotas off from 2 weeks post go-live.
  - Schedule less slots in the rotas for the first couple of days post go-live if your clinicians are not familiar with the target supplier’s system. Please note that if this is the case then apply these to the source supplier rotas too so that you are able to transfer them.

* Consultations:
  - Carry on as normal and manually transfer these to target source supplier as part of the data catch up process once you have gone live.

* Home visits:
 - You will need to keep a record of requested visits so that you know which patients have data that need transferring once you are live.

* Telephone calls to patients:
  - Your GPs/nurses need to ensure that all telephone calls to a patient are entered on to the clinical system, they will need to keep a record of the name of the patient and the date they were called so that they can find the info to transfer it. 
  - In order to negate the risk of missed information, create a rota in the source supplier system, if possible, so that all the calls made can be logged there.

* Prescriptions:
  - Keep a record of all prescription requests made/issued during the cutover period. Ideally batch all the repeat prescription requests together by date order. If any requests are taken by phone/over the counter/any other method, you will need to make a note of those and add them to the batched information.

* Referrals:
  - Print an extra copy of any referrals done during cutover period. These can then be scanned into the target supplier system when you are live. 

* Scanning:
  - Everything that comes in during the cutover period will need to be scanned into the target system’s supplier once you are live. You need to make sure that you keep all the incoming letters together.

* Links:
  - Cut off dates for reg and path links will be sent to you via e-mail. The backlog of pathology results will be sent electronically once you are live. 

* Bowel screening:
  - Asked to stop sending messages from a couple of days before cutover starts until after go-live. 

* 111 messages/Incoming clinical correspondence:
  - Leave all the messages received during the cutover period in the generic mailbox as they can be picked up from there and dropped into the target system once you are live. You may want to print copies for your GPs to view.

* Out Of Hours:
  - The OOH reports will continue to come into the source system during cutover. You will need to keep a copy of each for scanning into the target system once live. 

* Summarisation/routine data entry:
  - All of this will need to stop as the information will not be transferred to target supplier.


## Please take a note

- The source supplier system maintenance support will continue for 3 months post go-live and you will have access to it for this period.
- Any patients (other than deceased) deducted before your final data production won't migrate
- Some practices draft in additional support/cover so that there is dedicated people/time for testing
