During the cut-over phase, you will carry out all the activities planned for in the [cut-over preparation phase](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over).

## Who is involved
* Practice Staff
* Project Manager
* Trainers
* new supplier (target)


## What to expect during the cutover

### Final data production 
The cut-over will start with a ‘Final data production’. Practice staff continue using existing system (source) knowing that the data entered will not be migrated. 

The final data extract (excluding any data entered during cut-over) is provided to the new supplier (target), who import it into the new system.


### Manual processes are put in place
[Refer back to the cut-over planning for further details of the processes](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#appointments)


### Data re-checking

The practice should re-check the patients identified and tested previously as part of the [initial data production](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production) as well as random patients. 

Practice staff should recheck reports such as QOF and indicator points, cytology and immunisation target reports, capitation figures and the remapping of local codes.


### Training on the new system

Practice staff should receive [training for the new system](/prm-practice-migration/guide/training) during the Cut-over period including training for any changes to practice processes.

### Dictionary of Medication and Devices mapping {#dictionary-of-medication-and-devices-mapping}

Dictionary of Medication and Devices (DM&D) mapping needs to be done for the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS) during the cut-over


{%- capture lesson_learnt_2 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - DM&D may only be available 1-2 days before Go Live and if the DM&D is not checked, it causes issues with Electronic Prescription Service after Go Live.

### Configure devices

Scanning devices, check in and call waiting boards etc are configured. This is usually completed by the Clinical Support Unit (CSU)  


### Hardware replacement

By now, incompatible equipment identified in the [Technical Survey](technical-survey) should be replaced and tested.


### Activate Smartcards

Smartcards will need to be activated. The new system is configured for staff, roles, names of sites. Who does this varies between the Commissioning Support Unit, Trainers and Practice managers.


### Check Registration links

The new supplier (target) should check patient registration links are working in the new system, the Registrations clerk is usually involved with this activity.


### Sign off Go Live Data 

After re-checking, if the practice is satisfied that all the data has been transferred and the migration is successful, the practice can sign off Go Live Data and provide confirmation to the Supplier.  


## Go Live

Following the actions described previously and Sign off of the Go Live Data, the practice goes live on the new supplier's system. 

The old system is now read only and available for another 45 days as standard - __check this with your old supplier (source) to ensure that they do not terminate access early__.

Third party systems should come back online.

## What to look out for

* Staff availability for cut-over tasks.  

* Confirm your Go Live date with the new supplier (target) again to make sure there is no change in their schedules.  

* Each practice has its own MESH inbox/queue/secure file transfer. When MESH changes, teams need to inform partner services of the change in address.  

* Fixing some degraded codes and data can take practice weeks or months, due to poor transfer into the new system.

* New patients cannot complete registration until after the cut-off period so you will need to ask them to come back after Go Live.
