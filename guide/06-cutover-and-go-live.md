## What to expect - Cut-over

Practices can choose to continue to add data into the old supplier's system, but data wonâ€™t be carried over, so for some processes they may use paper or manual processes.  

Avoid reviews and other clinic sessions with high volume of patients during this period e.g. Asthma reviews.  

Reduce referrals to urgent only cases, retain a copy for re-entry.  

Patient consultations details are printed off and stored in a folder for re-entry after Go Live.  

Practice staff receive training from CSU for new system and processes.  

DM&D (Dictionary of Medication and Devices) mapping is done for Electronic Prescription Service.  

Practice staff re-check patient records on the new system.  

Practice staff re-check QOF and other reports.  

Practice signs off Go-live Data and provides confirmation to the Supplier.  

CSU configure scanning device, check in and call waiting boards etc.  

Incompatible equipment is replaced.  

Smartcard activation is completed by the CSU. New system configured for staff, roles, names of sites (can also be the responsibility of the Practice Manager).  

## What to expect - Go Live

Practice goes live on the new supplier's system. Old system is now read only and available for another 45 days.
This stage usually takes two days. Technical Go Live takes place one day before Business Go Live.

CSU on site to provide support and training.
In some circumstances, the Target supplier trainers arrive at the practice.

Some CSU provide training support on the new system and processes ongoing throughout cut-over for Practice staff trained, Dispensary staff and Nurses etc

Third party systems come back online.

Appointments and roles set up in the morning, roles are set up in the new system.

Paper data collected and managed manually over the cut-over period is re-entered: 
- Appointments
- Consultations
- Lab results
- Registration tasks
- Patient opt out codes

QOF score reports checked and markers are updated.  

Activity to fix data and code mapping starts for degraded codes.  


## What to look out for

DM&D and QOF are only available 1-2 days before Go Live and if not MD&D is not checked, it causes issues with EPS after Go Live.  

Staff availability for cut-over tasks.  

Confirm your Go Live date with the supplier again to make sure there is no change in their schedules.  

Each practice has its own MESH inbox/queue/secure file transfer. When MESH changes, teams need to inform partner services of the change in paths.  

Fixing some degraded codes and data can take practice weeks or months, due to poor transfer into the new system.

New Patients cannot complete registration and are asked to come back after the cut-off period.
