By now you will have completed the Go-Live steps and the Practice staff are now using the new clinical system and all data entered from now on will be maintained.


## Switch links back on & notify 3rd parties

Now your new system is up and running you can contact all the supporting/connecting systems and community services that the Clinical system or the Practice works with to switch services back on, for example...

* Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)
* Pathology and test labs
* Pharmacies
* Third party software/system suppliers, for example DocMan or Apollo Scan for document scanning and management

If you use any third party software as part of your clinical system, please be aware that reconfiguration work may be required by them now that the Practice has migrated to the new clinical system. 


## Data re-entry

If you have followed any manual processes/strategies during cutover that you established during the [Cutover Planning stage](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over#appointments), you can now start the task of re-entering the data captured.

The approach to this can differ depending on preferences. 

* Some practices choose to copy and paste data from the old system to the new
* Some practices choose to retype the notes from printouts they have created during the cutover


{%- capture lesson_learnt_1 -%}
__Lesson learnt__ - We strongly recommend that Practices draft in additional support/cover so that there is dedicated people/time for data re-entry. We have found from research that Practices that do not have dedicated time and people for data re-entry can struggle to complete the activity and causes additional strain on staff
{%- endcapture -%}

{%- include inset.html content=lesson_learnt_1 accessibility_text="Lesson learnt" markdown=true -%}


The average time to complete data re-entry can vary largely due to Practice size/number of patients and whether the practice has arranged dedicated people/time for data re-entry activity.

Practices with dedicated people/time for data re-entry generally take one week to catch up.


### Tasks include

* Printed appointments (or screenshots) are manually re-entered 

* Printed Prescriptions are manually re-entered 

* Practice re-does any outstanding scripts on the spine for EPS Repeat Dispensing patients that were cancelled in the pre-migration preparation work

* The non-urgent Pathology results start to arrive electronically in the new system

* Printed Pathology results are manually re-entered by practice staff/clinicians

* Patient consultations are manually re-entered by practice staff/clinicians

* Printed Referrals (urgent referrals) are manually re-entered 



## Registration

Patient Registration capability should now be available.


## Online services

Online patient services such as the ability to book appointments online are made available, unfortunately it's likely that patients will need to be re-registered individually by practice staff as the Online services patient data is not migrated by the supplier. You may want to find out which patients frequently used the Online services provided by the previous supplier and prioritise these for re-registration.


## Access to the old system

The old system is now read only and available for another 45 days as standard (Check this with your old supplier to ensure that they do not terminate access early). Practices sometimes require access for more than 45 days for cross referencing data, validation and mappingIf you require an extention to the 45 days, this should be agreed with the Clinical Commissioning Group and the new Supplier as this may incur additional costs.
