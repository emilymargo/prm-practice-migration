The migration will end at the point at which all data has been re-entered, practice staff are trained and are comfortably using the new system. Access to the old system has ended and the new system has been officially signed off by the practice.


## The ‘run-off period’ {#the-run-off-period}
The ‘run-off period’ is used to describe the time whereby the practice has access to both the old and new systems. The run-off period is usually 45 days however, this should be agreed with the suppliers 

Access to the old system is usually retained for cross referencing data, validation and mapping only.  

Practices sometimes require an extension to the 45 days, this should be agreed with the Clinical Commissioning Group as this may incur additional costs.

Arrangements will need to be in place to ensure access to Source Solution data and audit trails in human readable format. Your old supplier will need to provide any necessary support in line with contractual agreements.
<!-- [UPLIFT] added reference to need for audit trails using original format in which data was captured -->

## Update the Catalogue {#update-the-tracking-database}
<!-- [GAP] heading will need to read 'update the Catalogue' in any case -->
After the Practice has migrated, the Catalogue should be updated with the date on which deployment occurred. 
<!-- [UPLIFT] replace reference to Tracking Database with reference to Catalogue -->

{%- capture lesson_learnt_1 -%}
Not updating the Catalogue with the deployment details can cause issues with payments to the suppliers
<!-- [UPLIFT] replace reference to Tracking Database with reference to Catalogue -->
{%- endcapture -%}

{%- include inset.html content=lesson_learnt_1 accessibility_text="Lesson learnt" markdown=true -%}

<!-- [GAP] need to clarify how to update the Catalogue with the date on which deployment occurred...

Steps to do this…
* The new supplier (target) provides a ‘GPSoC-R Deployment Survey Form’ to the practice
* The practice completes the ‘GPSoC-R Deployment Survey Form’
  - The form includes a Go-Live Date. It is essential that the Go-Live Date is entered.
  - The form includes a ‘Deployment Score’ section. This allows the practice to review their satisfaction with the deployment of the system or service
  - The form includes a ‘Comments’ section. This allows the practice detail why they gave the Deployment Score and detail any areas where they feel the supplier could improve their Deployment Service
* Once the survey is complete, the practice sends the Deployment Survey Form to the Clinical Commissioning Group or Commissioning Support Unit (whichever is the assigned Tracking database administrator)
* The above assigned Tracking database administrator updates the Tracking database Schedule A Maintenance screen with the information that the practice has provided -->

## Retrospective and feedback

We encourage you to hold a ‘Retrospective’ session with all the key people involved. A retrospective is a meeting whereby you look back at the events that took part during the migration and assess the following…

* What worked well?


* What didn’t work so well?


* What would you do differently if you had to migrate again?


Any learnings from this session can be used by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) or GP IT delivery partner (such as a Commissioning Support Unit) to iterate and improve processes for future migrations.


## Send us your learnings

We would also like to receive any learnings you have from your migration so that we can iterate and improve this guide as well as the overall migration process.

Feedback and learnings can be sent to <a href="mailto:enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk?subject=Practice%20migration%20feedback%20-%20FAO%20Les%20Fawcett,%20NHS%20Digital&body=For%20the%20attention%20of%20Les%20Fawcett,%20Senior%20Project%20Manager,%20NHS Digital">enquiries@nhsdigital.nhs.uk</a> marked for the attention of Les Fawcett, Senior Project Manager, NHS Digital
