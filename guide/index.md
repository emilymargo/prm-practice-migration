This guide aims to help Practices, Delivery partners (e.g. Commissioning Support Units) and Commissioning Clinical Groups (CCGs) plan and implement practice migrations from one clinical system to another. 

Approaches to migration can differ by region. This guide contains a collection of common phases and strategies aimed at reducing the impact to Practice staff and minimising the amount of manual data re-entry which is a common problem when migrating systems.

The guide does not cover everything that may need to happen in your migration but it will cover the key activities and make suggestions on how to act on them. 


## How long does a migration take?

Migrations on average take between 12-16 weeks. This is from the point of registering the intent to migrate in the [Tracking Database](/prm-practice-migration/guide#register-the-migration-on-the-tracking-database) to the end of the [Post Go Live](/prm-practice-migration/guide/post-go-live) activity is complete.


## Overview of key phases

Migrations require a lot of planning and effort from Practice staff, breaking this activity into smaller incremental steps will help ease the pressure and make the migration effort more sustainable.

Here is an overview of the key phases...


| Phase                                                    | Estimated timeline |
|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| __[Decision to migrate & funding](/prm-practice-migration/guide/get-started#decision-to-migrate-and-funding)__ <br>The practice and Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) assess the business case for the practice to migrate to a new clinical System. If agreed, the funding is secured by the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). Note: there may be [further costs identified by the Technical Survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey) for replacing hardware| - |
| __[Procurement](/prm-practice-migration/guide/get-started#register-the-migration-on-the-tracking-database)__ <br>The notification and agreement with the new supplier (Target) and the old supplier (Source) via the [Tracking Database](#register-the-migration-on-the-tracking-database) | 1 to 2 weeks |
| __[Kick-off meeting](/prm-practice-migration/guide/kick-off)__ <br>Gathering all the key people who will be involved in your migration to discuss the end to end process of migrating your system    | 1 day |
| __[Technical survey](/prm-practice-migration/guide/technical-survey)__ <br>Checking the existing hardware and software at the Practice for compatibility. Scheduled to happen shortly after the Kick-off | 1 day |
| __[Pre-migration tasks](/prm-practice-migration/guide/pre-migration-tasks)__ <br>Critical activities Practices can start doing to get ahead and prepare for the later stages such as cleaning existing data, notifying 3rd Party services and patients | 1 to 2 weeks |
| __[Initial data production (IDP)](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production)__ <br>The Initial Data Production is the point at which a copy of the existing clinical system data is provided to the new supplier, who import it into the new system. The Practice then test the new system to make sure that the Patient data is accurate and the new system is working as expected. | 1 day |
| __[Data checking](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production#data-checking)__ <br>The Practice test the new system to make sure that the Patient data is accurate and the new system is working as expected. | 3 days to 3 weeks |
| __[Data recheck and sign off](/prm-practice-migration/guide/initial-data-production#data-checking)__ <br>Rechecking the data after the Target Supplier has amended any issues found before signing off that the data is accurate and the Practice is satisfied with the quality of the data | 1 to 5 days |
| __[Cut-over planning and preparation](/prm-practice-migration/guide/planning-for-cut-over)__ <br>Preparation and activities to reduce the impact of the Cut-over & data re-entry | - |
| __[Training](/prm-practice-migration/guide/training)__ <br>_Training can happen throughout the end to end migration process_ | - |
| __[Final data production](/prm-practice-migration/guide/cutover-and-go-live#final-data-production)__ <br> Practice staff cease to use Source system or continue using source system knowing that the data entered will not be migrated. The final data extract is provided to the new supplier, who import it into the new system.| 1 day |
| __[Cut-over period](/prm-practice-migration/guide/cutover-and-go-live)__ <br> Manual processes are put in place whilst the Practice check the data accuracy on the new system and receive training | 3 days to 2 weeks |
| __[Go Live](/prm-practice-migration/guide/cutover-and-go-live#sign-off-go-live-data)__ <br> The point at which the practice signs off that the data is accurate and starts to use the new system as the primary system | 1 day |
| __[Post Go Live](/prm-practice-migration/guide/post-go-live)__ <br> Practice staff re-enter data for Appointments, Prescriptions etc that took place during the Cut-over period | 5 days to 2 weeks |
| __[End of migration](/prm-practice-migration/guide/end-of-migration)__ <br> The point at which all data has been re-entered, all training is complete and the practice is comfortably using the new system. Access to the old system has ended and the new system has been officially signed off by the practice| - |
