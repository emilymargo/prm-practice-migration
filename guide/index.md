This guide aims to help Practices, GP IT delivery partners (such as Commissioning Support Units) and Commissioning Clinical Groups (CCGs) plan and implement practice migrations from one clinical system to another. 

Approaches to migration can differ by region. This guide contains a collection of common phases and strategies aimed at reducing the impact to Practice staff and minimising the amount of manual data re-entry which is a common problem when migrating systems.

The guide does not cover everything that may need to happen in your migration but it will cover the key activities and make suggestions on how to act on them. 

Two key documents are referenced throughout this guide:
* GP IT Futures Catalogue Solution Migration Process
* GP IT Futures Data Migration Standard
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added explanation that these two documents have content that appears throughout the guide -->

<p>When you see reference to an 'SLA', this is a Service Level Agreement that appears in the Catalogue Solution Migration Process. When you see reference to a 'DMI' code, this item is a requirement that forms part of the Data Migration Standard.</p>
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added explanation regarding how that additional content appears when lifted from those documents -->
This guide will continue to be updated, as the GP IT Futures framework develops and matures.
<!-- [UPLIFT] Added disclaimer to mention that the guide is not exhaustive in terms of reflecting all changes in the GP IT F framework -->

Performing a migration inevitably involves access to - and processing of - significant amounts of sensitive personal information. It's crucial, therefore, that all parties involved are compliant with the following laws, policies, standards and guidelines in respect to Information Governance:

<pre><code>* Access to Medical Reports Act (1988)
* Access to Health Records Act (1990)
* NHS Act 2006 (Section 251) (previously Section 60 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001)
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (see NHS Digital guidance on GDPR)
* NHS (Venereal Diseases) Regulations (1974)
* NHS Data Dictionary
* Records Management - NHS Code of Practice (DHSC)
</code></pre>

## How long does a migration take?

Migrations on average take between 12-16 weeks. This is from the point of registering the intent to migrate on the Catalogue to the end of the [Post Go Live](/prm-practice-migration/guide/post-go-live) activity is complete.
<!-- [GAP] Need to add details that explain how to register intent to migrate via the Catalogue -->


## Overview of key phases

Migrations require a lot of planning and effort from practice staff, breaking this activity into smaller incremental steps will help ease the pressure and make the migration effort more sustainable.

Here is an overview of the key phases...
