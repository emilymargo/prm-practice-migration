### Goal
This guide aims to help Practices, Commissioning Support Units (CSUs) and Commissioning Clinical Groups (CCGs) plan 
and prepare their migration from one core clinical system to another. 

### Good to know
Whilst approaches to migrating can differ by region, this guide contains a collection of common phases and strategies 
aimed at reducing the impact to Practice staff and minimising the amount of manual data re-entry which is a common problem when migrating systems.
