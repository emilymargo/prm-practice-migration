## About this Parthenon

This guide aims to help Practices, GP IT delivery partners (e.g. Commissioning Support Units) and Commissioning Clinical Groups (CCGs) plan and prepare their migration from one principal clinical system to another. 

Whilst approaches to migrating can differ by region, this guide contains a collection of common phases and strategies 
aimed at reducing the impact to Practice staff and minimising the amount of manual data re-entry which is a common problem when migrating systems.
